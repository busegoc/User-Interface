# User Interface Project
In this repo, I implemented a project that performs API integrations using React and Bootstrap. I used the axios library for my API requests. I performed a pagination process according to the page number from which I received the data from the API. I set 3 as the value to be displayed initially. Then, I prepared a component to fetch a user and made this process dynamic. It currently shows user number 2, but we can show a different user if we want. Finally, I used bootstrap forms to create a user and created the user by posting the information I received. Here, I used the toast library to show a warning if a user was created. Finally, while showing the date on which it was created, I made the necessary date adjustments to make it easier for the user to understand.
I hope you will like it!
